------------------ building the current version:

# cd D:\ungoogled-chromium-windows>
# clean everything but "download_cache" from "build"
for /d %i in ("D:\ungoogled-chromium-windows\build\*") do if not "%~nxi"=="download_cache" rd /s /q "%i"
del /q "D:\ungoogled-chromium-windows\build\*.*"

------------------ building a new version:

# clean everything when versions change
rd /s /q "D:\ungoogled-chromium-windows\build"

# patch update_lists.py so we don't remove ML stuff
python3 ungoogled-chromium/devutils/update_lists_patch.py

# for the prune list build/src must exist, if not, run build, don't let it finish:
python3 build.py # TODO: use ungoogled-chromium\utils\clone.py?

# recompute the prune list
python ungoogled-chromium/devutils/update_lists.py --tree build/src --domain-regex ungoogled-chromium/domain_regex.list

# todo: do we need to delete src again after we update the lists to avoid crashing the build? verify

------------------ shared:

# output is in build\src\out\Default, use package to copy the important dist files
# wait for the ninja phase - build script is prone to crashing before that but the phase shouldn't take more than 10 mins
python3 build.py
